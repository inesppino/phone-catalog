Code challenge from scratch.

It displays a list of phones.

# How does it work?

Clone this repository in your machine.

You will be needing json-server in order to access the data base.

In order to do so, you need to access the services folder from your terminal and run:  
 $npx json-server --watch phones.json

You should be running this server in port 3000.

Next, open another terminal and simply run npm start!
